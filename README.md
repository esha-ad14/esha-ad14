### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software engineer with a computer science and electrical engineering foundation. I have a bachelor's in Computer Engineering and Economics from Texas A&M University, which has given me a comprehensive understanding of the theoretical and practical aspects of technology. Over the years, I've gained skills in building robust, scalable web applications, and implementing best security practices. I enjoy learning about the latest tech trends and concepts. I like to write about what I learn and share it on my blog.
